data from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS). The data includes
literacy rates by age group ,gender ,country, and year. Through a
combination of exploratory data analysis, aggregation, and map-based
visualizations, this project reveals disparities and trends in literacy across
different regions of the world.

Objectives:
• To analyse global literacy trends by gender, age group, year, and region.
• To visualise country-level disparities using choropleth and bubble maps.
• To build interactive tools for exploring literacy rates over time and
geography.
• To draw data-driven conclusions about regional progress and gender gaps
in education
